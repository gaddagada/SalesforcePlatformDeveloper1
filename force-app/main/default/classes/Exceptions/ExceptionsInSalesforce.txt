Built-in exceptions in Salesforce are predefined exceptions that are automatically thrown by the Apex runtime system when specific error conditions occur. 
These exceptions help developers handle common error scenarios gracefully. Some common built-in exceptions in Salesforce Apex include:

1. **NullPointerException**: Thrown when an application attempts to use an object reference that has the null value.
2. **DmlException**: Thrown when a DML operation (like insert, update, delete) fails. This exception provides details about the failure, including the specific records 
that caused the error.
3. **QueryException**: Thrown when a SOQL query fails to execute properly, such as when it returns more than one record for a single-record query.
4. **StringException**: Thrown when an operation on a string fails, such as trying to access a character at an invalid index.
5. **ListException**: Thrown when an operation on a list fails, such as trying to access an index that is out of bounds.
6. **MathException**: Thrown when a mathematical operation fails, such as division by zero.
7. **IllegalArgumentException**: Thrown when a method receives an argument that is not
valid or appropriate.
8. **IllegalStateException**: Thrown when a method is invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time.
9. **SObjectException**: Thrown when there is an error related to SObject operations, such as accessing a field that does not exist.
10. **CalloutException**: Thrown when a callout to an external service fails.               
These built-in exceptions can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks in Apex code, allowing developers to implement robust error handling mechanisms in their applications.
